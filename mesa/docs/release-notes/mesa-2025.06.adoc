=== Sparx5: Added Support for Hierarchical Quality of Service (HQoS)

The MESA API has been extended with a new interface
(`mesa/include/microchip/ethernet/switch/api/hqos.h`) to enable HQoS. Currently,
this API is only implemented by Sparx5.

With HQoS, an ingress TCAM is used to classify traffic (typically a service) to
a `mesa_hqos_id_t`. Then, after the forwarding process, on the egress side, it
is possible to configure a scheduling element per port per HQoS ID (see
`mesa_hqos_add()`). Each service-layer scheduling element can perform traffic
shaping and Deficit Weighted Round Robin scheduling (DWRR) before traffic is
forwarded to the port's scheduling element.
