:vt: VLAN Translation

== Requisite

To change the default port to {vt} group assignment for a given switch port,
e.g. port 3 to be assigned to translation group 1.

== Solution

The necessary API for assigning a port to a translation group is
`mscc-sym:mesa_vlan_trans_group_to_port_set` and the container used to pass down all the
relevant information to the API is the 'struct' `mscc-sym:mesa_vlan_trans_port2grp_conf_t`.
That info is the translation group that needs to be configured and then a port list
which is used to specify which ports are to be members of the group.

NOTE: The port list is indexed zero-based.

The following code example will set switch port 3 to translation group 1.
