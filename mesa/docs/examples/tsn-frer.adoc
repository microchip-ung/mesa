== TSN FRER Example

The FRER example shows how to setup sequence generation and recovery using three different ports.
Stream Identification is done based on DMAC matching. All streams are classified to VLAN 10,
which includes the three ports:

* Untagged port:
** Ingress frames to DMAC 00:00:00:00:00:02 are mapped to an ingress flow with sequence generation.
** Egress frames for VLAN 10 are untagged.
* R-tagged port:
** Ingress frames to DMAC 00:00:00:00:00:01 are mapped to a Member Stream towards the untagged port.
** Egress frames for VLAN 10 are R-tagged.
* C-tagged port:
** Ingress frames to DMAC 00:00:00:00:00:01 are mapped to a Member Stream towards the untagged port.
** Egress frames for VLAN 10 are C-tagged and R-tagged.

The Member Streams from the R-tagged and C-tagged ports map to a Compound Stream with Sequence Recovery.
