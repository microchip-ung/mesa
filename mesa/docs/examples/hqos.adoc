== Hierarchical Quality Of Service (HQOS) example

Command 'example init hqos port_eg port_ig1 port_ig2 port_ig3' will configure three ports as ingress and one port as egress. +
The egress port is configured in `MESA_HQOS_SCH_MODE_HIERARCHICAL` mode. +
Use command 'example help hqos' to print details on the full configuration done by the init command.

Frames can be injected on the three ingress port and based on the TAG VID be mapped to one of the four HQOS entries
on egress port. +
Frames can be injected on the three ingress port and based on the TAG PCP be mapped to different priorities
for testing of the priority DWRR configuration. +
