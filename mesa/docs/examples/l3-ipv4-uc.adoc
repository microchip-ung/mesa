== IPv4 Unicast Routing Example

The IPv4 Unicast Routing example shows how to setup basic routing between two VLANs:

* Routing is enabled and a base MAC address is assigned.
* Router Legs for each VLAN are added.
* Direct routes for each VLAN are added.
* Direct routes for a host on each VLAN are added.
* An indirect route via a router for a remote network is added.
* Neighbour (ARP) entries are added for each host and the router
