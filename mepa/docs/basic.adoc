== Register Accessor Functions

These APIs allows to read/write PHY registers. For convenience, registers are
grouped and arranged page wise like general purpose registers in a page,
extended registers in few pages, GPIO registers in a page, 1588 registers in
a page, MACSEC registers in a page.

The API `mepa_clause22_read()` helps to read register of a PHY, given
regsiter address and page address embedded in address parameter.
The API `mepa_clause22_write()` helps to write register of a PHY,
given register address and page address embedded in address parameter and
value to be written.

Extended page registers can be accessed using `mepa_clause45_read()`
and `mepa_clause45_write()` APIs.

== PHY Information Details

The API `mepa_phy_info_get()` allows to get current PHY information
which includes `mepa_phy_info_t` details.

== Port Interface

Based on speed (`mepa_port_speed_t`) of the port, PHY interface details
(`mepa_port_interface_t`) are fetched using `mepa_if_get()`.

== Auto-Negotiation Status

Auto-negotiation allows UTP (unshielded twisted pair) link partners to select
the highest common mode of operation. During auto-negotiation, link partners
advertise capabilities across the UTP link to each other, and then compare
their own capabilities with those they received from their link partners. The
highest speed and duplex setting that is common to the two link partners is
selected as the operating mode.

The API `mepa_aneg_status_get()` is used to get auto negotiation
status of copper PHY using struct `mepa_aneg_status_t`.

== Power Mode Configuration

The API `mepa_power_set()` is used to configure power modes.
Supported modes are `mepa_power_mode_t` which is listed as following:

NOMINAL:: Default power settings to restore the original power level.
ACTIPHY:: Actiphy Power Mgmt mode that supports power sensitive applications.
DYNAMIC:: Enables PerfectReach capability at link-up to adjust power output
based on cable length.
ENABLED:: Enables Actiphy and PerfectReach together at link-up.

== Media Configuration

In case if port is dual media port with external PHY, media type
(`mepa_media_interface_t`) is set using API `mepa_media_set()`
API `mepa_media_get()` is used to get configured media type.

== Loopbacks

These APIs are used for debug purpose to check transmit and receive data
paths using different loopback modes (`mepa_loopback_t`).

The API `mepa_loopback_get()` allows getting loopback configuration
on a given PHY.

The API `mepa_loopback_set()` allows setting internal loopback on
a given PHY.

== PHY GPIO Configuration

GPIOs are general purpose Input/output pins which can be used for multiple
purposes. Few of those purposes are it can act as an input to a PIN, output
to a pin, to drive an internal signal and output the generated interrupt
from the PHY.

The API `mepa_gpio_mode_set()` helps to configure GPIO pin mode to
input , output and alternate function using struture `mepa_gpio_conf_t`.

The API `mepa_gpio_in_get()` allows to get the current GPIO configuration
on a given GPIO pin.

The API `mepa_gpio_out_set()` allows to set GPIO configuration, given
GPIO pin number and value to be written.

== Isolate Mode

The PHY may be forced to electrically isolate its data paths from MII or GMII.
When isolated, PHY shall respond to management trasactions.

The API `mepa_isolate_mode_conf()` can be used to enable or disable isolation
of PHY from MII or GMII interface.

== Register Dump

The API `mepa_debug_info_dump()` is used for debugging purpose ONLY.
This API will use trace function from callout APIs to dump information.
It will dump following registers:

* PHY registers like Basic and Extended page(0,1,2,3,4,5,7,28,29,31) registers.
* TS registers like classifier(IP, MAC, VLAN) configuration, TS general settings
and TS TX/RX settings.

== Delete PHY Instance

The API `mepa_delete()` is used to delete MEPA instance created for a
PHY. It clears up the data allocated in `mepa_create()` function.

== PHY SQI(Signal Quality Indicator) value
The API `mepa_sqi_read()` is used to get the signal quality indication

== PHY SOF(Start Of Frame) Pulse
The API `mepa_start_of_frame_conf_set` is used to set the start of frame
configuration for generation of an SOF pulse in receive and transmit paths
using structure `mepa_start_of_frame_conf_t`.

The above structure has below fields:

. `mepa_start_of_frame_conf_t::sof_no`: Four SOF outputs, each of which is
configurable to be any of the eight available SOF pulses (Tx SOF and Rx SOF on
each port).
. `mepa_start_of_frame_conf_t::ingress`: If true SOF pulse is detected for
ingress packet else it is detected for egress packet.  Direction of frame
transmission.
. `mepa_start_of_frame_conf_t::sof_preemption_mode`: This is an enum of type
`mepa_preemption_mode_t` which can be set to:
.. `MEPA_PREEMPTION_NORMAL_SFD` or `MEPA_PREEMPTION_SMD_E`: The SOF pulse is
generated for SMD-E (0xD5 / normal SFD).
.. `MEPA_PREEMPTION_SMD_EXCEPT_CONTINUOUS`: The SOF pulse is generated for any
of the SMD values listed in 802.3br-2016 except for the continuation frame:
SMD-V (0x07), SMD-R (0x19), SMD-E (0xD5) and SMD-S[0,1,2,3] (0xE6. 0x4C, 0x7F or
0xB3).
.. `MEPA_PREEMPTION_SMD_ALL`: The SOF pulse is also generated for the
continuation SMD values SMD-C[0,1,2,3] (0x61, 0x52, 0x9E or 0x2A).

The API `mepa_start_of_frame_conf_get` is used to get the start of frame
configuration

== PCH/MCH and Frame Preemption support

The extension-type (refered to as `ExtTy` in the datasheets) in the preamble is
used by the PCH/MCH and the Preemption features.

A MAC which support PCH/MCH, but does not support preemption will transmit
frames with `ExtType` set to either `0b00` or `0b01`:

- `0b00`: indicate that the frame shall be forwarded normally and not perform any
  timestamping operations.
- `0b01`: indicate that the frame shall be timestamped.

A MAC which support PCH/MCH preemption will always set the `ExtType` to `0b10`,
regardless of if the frame shall be timestamped or not. In this case extention
bit 31 is used to signal if a frame shall be timestamped or not.

The PHY and MAC needs to agree on how time-stamp requests are signal in the
frame. By default the PHY will use `ExtType` `0b00` or `0b01` and discard frames
with `0b10`.

If the PHY is connected to a MAC which generates frames with `ExtType == 0b10`
and signales timestamp request in extension bit 31, then
Frame Preemption on the PHY can be Enabled through API `mepa_framepreempt_set()`.
The API's Boolean Argument `value` enables or disables frame preemption on a specified PHY port.

The API `mepa_framepreempt_get()` determines the status of frame preemption on a port,
indicating whether Frame Preemption is enabled or disabled.

== PHY Self-Test Frame Generation and Checking
The API `mepa_selftest_start()` is used to start PHY self-test Frame generation in connector loopback mode.
The API `mepa_selftest_read()` is used to read PHY correct and error frames in 10/100/1000M speed
Use `mepa_reset()`, to disable self-test on PHY

== Pseudo Random Binary Sequence (PRBS7) Generation and Checker
PRBS generators are used in telecommunication, such as in analog-to-information conversion,
but also in encryption, simulation, correlation technique and time-of-flight spectroscopy.
The  sequence is  generated by a (maximal) linear feedback shift register (LFSR).
PRBS-7 has a repetition period of 127 values.

The API `mepa_prbs_set()` is used for enable or disable, mode selection, clock selection(25MHz or 125MHz), loopback selection, type selection, direction selection.
The API `mepa_prbs_get()` is used for getting the configuration of PRBS.
The API `mepa_prbs_monitor_set()` is used for injecting an error into the PRBS sequence.
The API `mepa_prbs_monitor_get()` is used to get the error count of PRBS sequence.

NOTE: PRBS CHECK DOES NOT RESTORE QSGMII SETTINGS AFTER OPERATION SO A CHIP RESET FOLLOWED BY A REINITIALIZATION IS REQUIRED Ref. "mepa_instantiation::6. Link Up Sequence"
