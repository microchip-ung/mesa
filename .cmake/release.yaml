  # If set to true, the script will attempt to map the bugs into "modules" and
  # sort them by these modules along with the name of the module. This only
  # works for Bugzilla bugs, because these are the only ones mapped into a
  # component. Management has decided not to use the component field in Jira,
  # so Jira bugs will be mapped in a category called "Other".
  # If set to false, the script will list all bugs in numerical order, and won't
  # take into account the component (in fact, the script won't check that it
  # maps into a correct component).
  #
  # In projects that use both Jira and Bugzilla, you would probably want to set
  # this to false.
  # In projects that only use Bugzilla, you would probably want to set this to
  # true.

  # OPTIONAL. Defaults to false.

  # If set to true, the script will write a section to the release note with

  # OPTIONAL. Defaults to false.

  # This goes into the top of the release note as a one-liner description
  # Normally, you want to leave this at its default value.
  #
  # OPTIONAL. Default is derived as follows:
  #    If the branch name does not end with "-soak" or "-rel", the description
  #    becomes "Pre-release".
  #    Otherwise, if the branch name starts with "x.y.z-" and z is non-zero,
  #    it's a minor release, and the description becomes "Maintenance release".
  #    Otherwise, the descripton becomes "Roadmap release".

  # When generating a list of blocker and critical BZs in the application
  # release note, we need to know which BZ database target milestones to look
  # for yet-unresolved bugs.
  # The future_milestones is a space-separated list of such milestones.
  # Use '%' as a wildcard.
  #
  # Example:
  # future_milestones: API-5.1% API-5.2%
  #
  # OPTIONAL. If not specified, release note will not contain list of unresolved
  # BZs.
  # future_milestones: API-5% **API-5.5%

  # When generating a list of blocker and critical Jira bugs in the application
  # release note, we need to know which Jira project to look for yet-unresolved
  # bugs.
  # The future_jira_bugs is a JQL query string that can be suited for the
  # project's needs. Typically, you will search only for bugs in a particular
  # project, so on WebStaX2's 4-dev branch, where the bugs are prefixed with
  # "APPL-" you would write:
  #    future_jira_bugs: project="APPL"
  #
  # The release note script will only look for bugs not resolved or closed and
  # with a priority of Blocker or Critical.
  #
  # OPTIONAL. If not specified, the release note will not contain a list of
  # unresolved Jira bugs.
  future_jira_bugs: project="MESA"

# Control the bugs added or not added to the release note.
# OPTIONAL.
bugs:
  # This section allows for adding and removing bugs from the release notes.
  #
  # The reason that you may want to remove a bug is that the Jira and Bugzilla
  # numbers used for the release notes are coming from GIT commit strings, and
  # it is not unusual that a changeset author happens to write a wrong bug ID.
  #
  # At times, it is possible to identify the correct bug ID that the author
  # should have put, in which case, that ID can be added to the 'add:' section.
  #
  # For Bugzillas, use "Bugzilla#XXXX".
  # For Jira issues, use "APPL-XXXX" eller "MESA-XXXX"
  #
  # Please provide a comment when removing/adding bugs to these lists.
  #
  # Example of a list:
  # del:
  #   - Bugzilla#12345 # Remove from release note, because someone committed with wrong BZ ID. Use 12344 instead
  #   - Bugzilla#23456 # Remove from release note, because someone committed with wrong BZ ID. Can't find correct BZ ID.
  #   - AA-1234        # Remove from release note, because...
  #
  # OPTIONAL. No bugs will be removed if not specified.
  del:
    - MESA-909
    - MESA-2023 # Not a bug, but the name of the release

  # See the 'del' section above for a description
  #
  # Example of a list:
  # add:
  #   - Bugzilla#12344 # Add Bugzilla#12344 from release note in place of Bugzilla#12345
  #
  # OPTIONAL. No bugs will be added if not specified.
